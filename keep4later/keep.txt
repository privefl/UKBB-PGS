\subsection*{Heritability and prediction}

Figure \ref{fig:heritability} shows that heritability estimates from LDpred2-auto is largely similar to estimates from LD score regression (LDSC, using a 3cM window), except for phenotypes with smaller proportion of causal variants $p$ for which estimates from LDSC are unreliable.
Figures \ref{fig:heritability-quant} and \ref{fig:heritability-binary} report heritability estimates from LDpred2-auto from quantitative and binary traits.
[DESCRIBE SOME OF THEM?]
\cite{daetwyler2008accuracy} have derived the following formula for the upper bound of the predictive accuracy of polygenic scores: $r^2 = \dfrac{h^2}{1 + (1 - r^2) \frac{M_c}{N h^2}}$, where $h^2$ is the SNP heritability, $M_c = M \cdot p$ is the number of independent loci affecting a trait and $N$ is the sample size.
We verify this equation by comparing the observed partial correlation of the PGS with the solution $r$ from this equation using the estimates from LDpred2-auto as parameters (Figure \ref{fig:upper-formula}).
We then slightly modify this equation by using $M_c = M \cdot p^\alpha$; the best fit to the data is obtained for $\alpha = 0.68$ (Figure \ref{fig:power-pred-formula}) and provides analytical values for the correlation that are very close the observed ones (Figure \ref{fig:pred-formula}).

\subsection*{Using family history to improve genetic prediction}

We first replicate the analyses of \cite{hujoel2020liability} proposing the LT-FH method to estimate the genetic liability of individuals based on family history in order to improve power in GWAS.
We derive the LT-FH phenotypes for the same 12 traits for the individuals in the training set.
We then run separately a GWAS using either the case-control phenotypes or the corresponding LT-FH phenotypes.
When comparing Z-Scores obtained from the GWAS of the LT-FH phenotypes to the ones using case-control phenotypes, we report increase in power from 28\% for prostate cancer to 580\% for Alzheimer's disease (Figure \ref{fig:power-ltfh}).
This shows that the LT-FH phenotypes better capture the genetic liability of the disease compared to the case-control phenotype.

Then, we also use these LT-FH phenotypes to train penalized regressions and see if this could improve predictive performance compared to using the case-control phenotype.
We report non-significant improvements in predictive performance for breast cancer (174.1), type-2 diabetes (250.2) and coronary artery disease (411.4) when evaluating both predictive models using the case-control status of individuals in the test set (Figure \ref{fig:lasso-ltfh}).
