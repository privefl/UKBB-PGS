# Introduction

---

### Major strengths of this study using the UK Biobank 

<br>

- A major concern about PGS is their transferability to other ancestries    
(e.g. bad performances in Africans for PGS trained in Europeans)

- UKBB is perfect to provide more detailed evidence of this concern

    - UKBB data contains 450K British, 9K South Asians, 2K East Asians and 7K Africans (including Caribbeans), and other (South and East Europe, Middle East)
    
    - many different phenotypes are available (we use 240)
    
    - $\Rightarrow$ high-resolution analysis, averaged over many traits
    
    - individuals had their genetic and phenotypic information derived **in the same way**
    
    - $\Rightarrow$ circumvent potential bias when using independent studies

# Methods

### Ancestry grouping

(Full supplementary note on this) Summary:

- We show that squared Euclidean distances on PCs are proportional to $F_{ST}$

- Then use these distances and country of birth to define 8 ancestry groups:

```{r, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://privefl.github.io/predict-everything/figures/UKBB-matched-country.png")
```

---

### Genetic data

<br>

- 1,040,096 HapMap3 variants (but also secondary analyses with high-quality genotyped variants or a larger set of imputed variants)

- Training based on individuals of British ancestry and testing in all 8 ancestry groups (also try training using multiple ancestries)

<br>

```{r, out.width="98%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/table1.JPG")
```

---

### Phenotypic data

<br>

- Mapped ICD10 and ICD9 codes to phecodes $\rightarrow$ 104 phecodes with sufficient prediction

- Used other UKBB fields to define 111 continuous and 25 binary phenotypes

    $\Rightarrow$ 111 continuous + 129 binary = **240 phenotypes**
    
<br>

Some examples:

- body measures: height, BMI, BMD, etc.

- blood biochemistry: cholesterol, vitamin D, etc.

- ECG measures

- misc

### Predictive methods

<br>

- Penalized regression (LASSO, https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.119.302019) based on individual-level training data -> fast for all binary phenotypes and half of the continuous ones (take more than one day for only a few).

- LDpred2-auto (https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa1029) on summary statistics derived from the individual-level training data (take about seven hours for each phenotype).

---

### Prediction accuracy

<br>

**Partial correlation** between PGS (x) and phenotype (y), adjusting for covariates (z).

Basically, regress out x and y by z to get x_eps and y_eps, and compute cor(x_eps, y_eps).

.footnote[Percentage in figure title = squared slope (in blue) // same with LDpred2-auto instead of penalized regression or genotyped variants instead of HM3.]
