<!-- ### Introduction  -->

- **Polygenic scores (PGS)**, which aggregates information from multiple variants into a single predictor, have shown **great promise** for identifying high-risk (or low-risk) individuals for several diseases

- However, **portability** of PGS across ancestries is **concerning**  
(e.g. PGS trained using European individuals underperform in African individuals)

### What does our study add?

The UK Biobank data can provide more detailed evidence of this concern

- The UK Biobank data contains 450K individuals of British ancestry, but also from many other ancestries; we define **9 large ancestry groups**:
```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/table1-2.JPG")
```

- there are many different phenotypes available (we use **245**)

$\Longrightarrow$ higher-resolution ancestry analysis, averaged over many traits

- individuals all live in the UK and had their genetic and phenotypic information derived **in the same way**

$\Longrightarrow$ circumvent potential bias when using independent studies

- using individual-level data makes deriving PGS highly reliable, and we use different methods: *penalized regression* and *LDpred2-auto*

### Predictive performance drops with genetic distance

### Take-home messages

- We provide simple solutions for high-resolution ancestry inference, and use them to define 9 ancestry groups in the UK Biobank  

- We show a dramatic reduction of predictive performance in other ancestries, already within Europe, and increasing with PC distance to the training population

- This predictive reduction is consistent with previous studies $^{[1]}$, even though PGS are derived and applied in the same cohort

- Our results are robust because we average over 245 phenotypes, run two different predictive methods and use multiple sets of variants

***

- PGS effects for 215 phenotypes are made available 

- Accepted in AJHG / available as medRxiv preprint

- What's next? More populations and multiple-ancestry training
